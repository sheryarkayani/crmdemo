## Complete Automated Flow

### **New Email Received → Detection → Processing Pipeline:**

   - Duplicate prevention using Gmail message ID
   - Email parsing and data extraction

2. **Inquiry Creation** ✅
   - Creates task in "New Inquiry" group
   - Generates unique inquiry ID (INQ-[timestamp]-[company])
   - Stores email metadata (sender, subject, body, etc.)

3. **Contact Detection** ✅
   - Checks if sender exists in Contacts or Leads boards
   - Links inquiry to existing contact if found
   - Creates new lead if sender is unknown

4. **Acknowledgement & Registration** ✅
   - Sends acknowledgment email with inquiry ID
   - Attaches client/vendor registration form
   - Logs email activity

5. **Product Category Assignment** ✅
   - Analyzes email subject and company name
   - Maps to specific categories (Tank Cleaning, Chemical Trading, etc.)
   - Updates task with determined category

6. **Sales Rep Assignment** ✅
   - Finds sales rep with expertise in product category
   - Checks availability and workload
   - Assigns task to suitable rep

7. **Status & Group Management** ✅
   - **If assignment successful**: Status → "Assigned", Group → "Assigned"
   - **If assignment fails**: Status → "Immediate Action", Group → "Immediate Action"
   - Logs assignment results and reasons

8. **Validation & Blocking** ✅
   - Prevents "Assigned" status without product category
   - Blocks assignment if sales rep lacks expertise
   - Moves to "Immediate Action" if validation fails

## Database Schema Requirements

The system requires the following fields in the `tasks` table:

```sql
-- Essential email integration fields
ALTER TABLE tasks 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sender_email TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sender_name TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sender_company TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS gmail_message_id TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_received_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

-- Product category and assignment fields
ALTER TABLE tasks 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS product_category TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS assigned_sales_rep TEXT;

-- Custom fields for enhanced functionality
ALTER TABLE tasks 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS custom_fields JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb;
```

## Product Categories Supported

- **Tank Cleaning**: Industrial cleaning, maintenance, storage tanks
- **Chemical Trading**: Chemical supply, raw materials, industrial chemicals
- **Equipment Supply**: Machinery, industrial equipment, tools
- **Consulting Services**: Advisory, professional services, business development
- **General Inquiry**: Default category for unspecified requests

## Sales Rep Assignment Logic

1. **Expertise Matching**: Finds reps with specific category expertise
2. **Availability Check**: Ensures rep isn't overloaded (>10 active tasks)
3. **Fallback Logic**: Assigns general sales rep if no expert available
4. **Manual Override**: Allows manual assignment for failed auto-assignments

## Group Management

The system automatically creates and manages these groups:

- **"New Inquiry"**: Initial group for new email inquiries
- **"Assigned"**: Tasks successfully assigned to sales reps
- **"Immediate Action"**: Tasks needing manual intervention
- **"New Leads"**: Automatically created leads for new contacts
- **"Manual Leads"**: Manually created leads by sales reps

## Error Handling & Logging

- **Comprehensive Logging**: All actions logged to `activity_log` table
- **Graceful Degradation**: Email failures don't break task creation
- **Validation Warnings**: Logs assignment issues for manual review
- **Retry Logic**: Implements fallback mechanisms for failed operations

## Manual Intervention Points

1. **Sales Rep Assignment**: For tasks in "Immediate Action" group
2. **Lead Creation**: Manual lead creation in Leads board
3. **Lead Qualification**: Moving leads to Contacts board
4. **Product Category Updates**: Manual category assignment if auto-detection fails

## Next Steps for Frontend Integration

The backend implementation is complete. Frontend components can now:

1. **Display Assignment Status**: Show which tasks need manual assignment
2. **Sales Rep Selection**: Interface for manually assigning sales reps
3. **Product Category Management**: Allow manual category updates
4. **Group Visualization**: Display tasks in their respective groups
5. **Assignment Dashboard**: Overview of assignment status across all tasks

## Testing the Implementation

To test the complete flow:

1. Send a test email to the connected Gmail account
2. Check console logs for the complete pipeline execution
3. Verify task creation in "New Inquiry" group
4. Check product category assignment
5. Verify sales rep assignment (if available)
6. Confirm group movement based on assignment success/failure
7. Check activity logs for detailed execution tracking

## Support & Troubleshooting

- **Console Logs**: Comprehensive logging for debugging
- **Activity Logs**: Database-stored execution history
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for common failures
- **Validation Results**: Clear feedback on assignment requirements
